# Migrating FingerprintJS v4 to v5

This guide covers the changes you need to make when upgrading your application from FingerprintJS version 4 to version 5.

## License

Version 5 returns FingerprintJS to the MIT license. Review the table below to understand how the terms compare to the Business Source License (BSL) that covered v4.

| | Version 4 (BSL 1.1) | Version 5 (MIT) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| License terms | [Business Source License 1.1](https://mariadb.com/bsl11/) | [MIT](../licensing.md) |
| Use for research / non-commercial purposes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Use in production without a commercial agreement | ❌ | ✅ |
| Fork and self-host in production | ❌ | ✅ |

See the full licensing statement in `docs/licensing.md` for details.

## Installation

The migration process depends on the way you install the library.

### CDN

Change the version number in the URL from `4` to `5`. For example:

```diff
- https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v4/iife.min.js
+ https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v5/iife.min.js
```

### NPM or Yarn

Update the package version:

```bash
npm install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

## JavaScript output and browser support

### Updated compilation target

The distributed bundles are now compiled to ES2018 instead of ES5. Modern build tools already handle this target, but any pipeline that assumed ES5 output (for example, older minifiers or ES5-only runtime environments) may require updates to accept or transpile ES2018 syntax.

### Supported browsers

The minimum browser versions officially supported by FingerprintJS are listed in the [browser and device support guide](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/browser-and-device-support#browsers). Confirm that the browsers you rely on meet or exceed these versions before deploying v5.

### Transpiling to ES5 when required

If you must keep ES5-compatible artifacts—for example, when embedding FingerprintJS into legacy applications—you now need to run that transpilation yourself. A typical setup using Babel might look like:

```jsonc
// babel.config.json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "ie": "11"
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
        "corejs": "3.38"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Or, if you compile with TypeScript, adjust your `tsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "downlevelIteration": true
  }
}
```

Make sure that your bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Vite, etc.) picks up these settings so that the FingerprintJS package is transpiled along with your application code.

For Webpack with `babel-loader`, explicitly include the library so it is processed despite the default `node_modules` exclusion:

```ts
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules\/(?!@fingerprintjs\/fingerprintjs)/, // this will transpile FingerprintJS
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: [
              [
                '@babel/preset-env',
                {
                  targets: { ie: '11' },
                  useBuiltIns: 'usage',
                  corejs: '3.38'
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you use TypeScript, ensure that the bundler reads your `tsconfig.json` (for example via `ts-loader` or `babel-loader` with `@babel/preset-typescript`) so that the downlevel settings apply to both your code and FingerprintJS.
