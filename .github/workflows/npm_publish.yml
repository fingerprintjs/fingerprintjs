# Reference on this file: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
# In order to work properly, this workflow requires the repository to have an environment called "npm". The environment
# must have a secret called NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN that holds an NPM access token that allows to publish the packages.
# The environment should be protected to allow running only on the master branch.
